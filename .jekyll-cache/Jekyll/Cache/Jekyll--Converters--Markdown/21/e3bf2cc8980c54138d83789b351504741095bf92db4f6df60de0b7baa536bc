<p>Two in a roll! Congratulations to Purit Phan-udom, Naruedon Wattanakul, Tattiya Sakulniwat for getting their senior project work titled ‚ÄúTeddy: Automatic Recommendation of Pythonic Idiom Usage for Pull-Based Software Projects‚Äù published as a tool demonstration paper at the 36th International Conference on Software Maintenance and Evolution (ICSME).</p>

<p>The work published is an automated tool, called Teddy, that promotes the usage of Pythonic idioms. The tool offers a prevention mode with Just-In-Time analysis to recommend the use of Pythonic idiom during code review and a detection mode with historical analysis to run a thorough scan of idiomatic and non-idiomatic code.
